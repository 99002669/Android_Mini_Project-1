<p style='text-align: justify;'> Keyboard plus is an application with the help of which we can make a call to any number we want. There are three options provided in this app. The first one is by simply dialing any number we want to call. In this case we have to dial the number and then we have to press the call button to make a call. The second option is speech to text option. In which we will enable this option then we will click on the mic icon to speak after that speech gets converted into text and the number will be visible on the screen so that we can verify that number. After verifying the number we have to click on the call icon to make a call. The third option is text to speech. In this case we have to type the number to whom we want to call. </p>
